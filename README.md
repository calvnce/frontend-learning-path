# ABOUT
Here I walk through a structured course that teaches all that is needed to know to become a front-end web developer. Work through each section, learning new skills (or improving existing ones) as I navigate along. Each section includes exercises and assessments to test the mastery of the material before moving forward. However, this repository excludes the tests.
